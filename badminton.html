            </li>
            <p style="color: white;">Badminton is a dynamic racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court divided by a net. Players use a shuttlecock (a feathered or plastic projectile) to hit it over the net, aiming to land it in the opponent's half of the court in such a way that the opponent is unable to return it effectively.</p>
            <li>
            <h2>Key Techniques and Strategies</h2>
            </li>
            <p>Badminton involves a wide range of techniques and strategies, including serving, smashing, drop shots, clears, and net play. Players must exhibit agility, speed, and precision while employing tactics such as deception, placement, and variation in shot selection to outmaneuver their opponents. Footwork is crucial in badminton, enabling players to reach and return shots effectively.</p>
            <li>
        <h2>International Tournaments and Championships</h2>

            </li>
                <p>Badminton features a diverse array of international tournaments and championships, including the prestigious All England Open Badminton Championships, BWF World Championships, and the Summer Olympic Games. These events attract top players from around the world and offer significant prize money, world ranking points, and opportunities for players to showcase their skills on the global stage.</p>

                  Badminton matches are typically played in a best-of-three-games format. Points are scored by landing the shuttlecock within the opponent's court boundaries, resulting in a rally. The winning side of each rally earns a point, with the serving side scoring if they win the rally and the receiving side scoring if they win. The first side to reach 21 points wins the game, provided they have a two-point advantage. If the score reaches 20-20, the game continues until one side has a two-point lead or until the score reaches 30-29, after which the first side to reach 30 points wins.

Servers aim to deliver accurate and deceptive serves that challenge the opponent's positioning and timing, while returners strive to anticipate and counter the serve effectively. Tactics such as flick serves, short serves, and drive returns are employed to gain a tactical advantage and control the pace of play.
